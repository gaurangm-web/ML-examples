## ML-examples

Repo for python codes applying ML/DL methods to biomed datasets.

**ML_classif_examples.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook with worked out example applying standard ML methods (RF, Boosting/ensemble, MLP, LogReg etc.) on a multi-class classification task. Also covers basic EDA of another example (high-D gene expression microarray dataset from CuMiDa database). This template can be used to work through other similar examples (e.g. datasets from Kaggle).
